# Overview
Teamstudio Usage allows you to track user activity of Notes applications, providing insight into usage trends that will help you make better decisions about your databases and your IT environment. It has two modules: Catalog and Usage.

## Catalog

The Catalog module reads information from your Domino server catalogs and address books to provide core lists of databases, templates and users. You can use the catalog to browse your databases by name, server, template or how recently they have been modified. The catalog module also allows you to configure filters to exclude certain databases and users from the other modules.

More details are available on the [Catalog](catalog.md) page.

## Usage

The Usage module imports usage information from your Domino server logs and displays detailed usage statistics for both users and databases. For a database, you can see how many times it was accessed and by whom, along with historical trends showing whether the usage is increasing or decreasing. For a user, you can see which databases and servers they accessed.

More details are available on the [Usage](usage.md) page.
