It serves as a master list of all databases, templates and users on your servers. The catalog is updated every time you run a server scan. Once you have configured Teamstudio Usage, you can update the catalog at any time by choosing Scan Servers from the File menu. This will update both Catalog and Usage data. Note Teamstudio Usage reads the catalog data from catalog.nsf on each scanned server, not by scanning the server's data directory. Any changes made on the server, such as adding and removing databases, will not be detected until the server has run its catalog task to update catalog.nsf. This is typically scheduled to run overnight. Viewing the Catalog To view the catalog, select the first tab in the Usage window, titled Catalog . Viewing Databases With the Catalog tab selected, select the Databases tab from the second tab row. This will display the catalog database view. This view is divided into two halves. On the left, a table lists all of the databases, along with key properties for each database. If you select a database, the detail pane on the right will show all of the properties for that database, including the ACL. The table, as with all tables in Usage, is both sortable and searchable. Clicking on a column header will sort the table based on that column. Clicking again will sort in reverse order, and clicking one more time will remove the sorting. If you click on the table and press Ctrl+F , a search panel will be displayed that you can use to temporarily filter which databases are displayed. Note that this searching is intended for quickly locating a database in the list. If you want to limit which databases are shown in the list, see the Filters section below. You can change the relative sizes of the list and details pane, and your choices will be saved. You can even close the details pane altoghter if you want to view more of the table. To re-open it, double-click on any database in the table. Teamstudio Usage does not maintain a full history of the results of all catalog scans. However, it will never remove a database once it has been added to the catalog, since it may have associated usage data. You can quickly see whether a database was present in the most recent catalog scan by looking for the server icon next to the database path. If this icon is missing, the database was not found on the most recent server scan. You can also see on the details pane a checkbox showing whether the database was present in the last server scan, and the timestamp when the database was last found in a scan. The database list may also contain databases that have never been found in catalog.nsf, although this is rare. This can happen if Usage encounters an unknown database when importing usage data. There needs to be a catalog entry to own the usage data, so we create a 'stub' entry containing just the database server and path. Viewing Users With the Catalog tab selected, select the Users tab from the second tab row. This will display the catalog user view. This view works very similarly to the databases view, described above. However, there is no server icon showing whether a user was found during the most recent scan because no one server is the final authority on whether a user name exists. The same user may be defined in multiple address books on different servers, and may be present in some but not others. User and Server Names Teamstudio Usage stores all user and server names internally in full canonical form (e.g., CN=Demo Adviser/O=Teamstudio ). The UI displays only the common name ( Demo Adviser in the previous example.) You can hover over the name to view the full name in abbreviated form ( Demo Adviser/Teamstudio .) Filters Filters allow you to hide databases and users from the UI based on a range of criteria. Teamstudio Usage will continue to collect catalog and usage data for any filtered databases and users, so you can add and remove filters at any time with no loss of data. To filter a database or user, switch the the appropriate tab in the catalog, right-click on the entry you want to hide and choose Ignore from the popup menu. This will give you a list of options based on the selected element. For a user, the only option is to hide that specific user. For a database, you can hide based on the database's path, template name or replica ID.

You can rerun it at any time by choosing Configuration from the File menu. Configuration Settings Notes Program Folder Teamstudio Usage uses a helper program, CatScan, to read catalog and usage information from Domino servers. Usage will add the folder specified here to the path before invoking CatScan. If you see an error like when attempting to scan your servers then this folder is not set correctly. Teamstudio Usage will attempt to set this correctly but you may need to change it if you have multiple versions of Notes installed. Notes INI Location The location of the notes.ini file is also required to run CatScan. This will usually be set correctly for you, but you can modify it if necessary. Note You need to specify the full path to the notes.ini file here, including the file name. Do not just provide the folder containing the ini file. Notes ID File The full path and name of the Notes ID file to use when scanning servers (e.g., C:\\Notes\\Data\\User.id .) Password The password for the Notes ID file above. The password is stored in an encrypted form, but it is passed to the CatScan program in plain text when you perform a scan. If you do not want to store a password, you can leave this blank and instead ensure that your Notes client is running whenever you run Usage. To allow Notes to share credentials with Usage, you must choose File|Security|User Security... from the menu in the Notes client, and check the box labeled Don't prompt for a password from other Notes-based programs (reduces security) . Domino Servers The list of servers that Teamstudio Usage will scan for catalog and usage information. To add a new server to the list, enter the server name, and press the Add button. You can enter the server name in any form that is convenient for you: canonical, abbreviated, or just the common name. Usage will always contain the full canonical server name. To remove a server from the list, select the server and press the Remove button. Note If you remove a server from this list, Usage will not include that server in future scans. However, all existing information will be retained. Teamstudio Usage never deletes any catalog or usage data. To pick from a list of available servers, click the down arrow at the end of the server name field and select <Scan> from the dropdown. This will populate the dropdown with a list of known servers from the address books on your local client and home mail server. Note that the ability to scan for available servers relies on earlier Notes settings being correct so you may see an error if, for example, the Notes program folder is not set correctly. There is no hard-coded limit on the number of servers that you can scan, but the time required to recompute usage statistics may become significant in large, busy environments. See Performance for more details. Schedule As with other information stored in log.nsf, activity logging will be deleted after a short retention period. By default this is two weeks. In order to ensure that Usage doesn't miss any activity data, you should run usage scans regularly. Once the data is imported into Usage, it will be retained permanently. To help with this, Teamstudio Usage can use the Windows Task Scheduler to run regular scans. This option allows you to schedule a scan every day at a time of your choosing. This will work for many cases, but if you require a more complex schedule then you can edit the task directly in Windows Task Scheduler. Note The Task is registered in the Task Scheduler Library under the Folder Teamstudio\\Usage . The task is not configured to wake your computer from sleep since this is not supported in all environments, but it is configured to catch up on missed scans. So as long as you use your computer regularly, scans will still run even if your computer is asleep at the scheduled time. Note If you use a different system for running scheduled tasks on your computer, you need to configure the system to run the command Usage.exe --scan . With a standard installation, Usage.exe will be installed into C:\\Program Files\\Teamstudio\\Usage . It is important that the same user credentials are used for scheduled scans and running the Usage UI since configuration settings and data are stored in the user's AppData\\Local\\Teamstudio\\Usage folder.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"configuration/#configuration","text":"You must run the Configuration wizard before you can use Teamstudio Usage.

Three different report formats are available. Databases The Databases report has one row for each database in the catalog. It defaults to a basic set of catalog properties and usage data, and you can optionally add any additional properties you need. Users The Users report has one row for each user in the catalog. As with the Database report, a core set of catalog and usage properties are provided by default, and you can add any additional ones you need. Detail The Detail report is useful when you need to analyze which users are accessing which database. It contains one row for every user/database combination that has a non-zero usage count. So for a given database, you can see which users are accessing that database, and for a given user you can see which databases they have accessed. You can add additional catalog and usage properties to the report if needed. Filtering Data Reports respect any existing database and user filters you have defined. So, for example, a database that has been filtered out will not appear at all in Databases and Detail reports and will not be included in any usage counts in a Users report. Note Reports include only usage data by users. Server and Agent usage is excluded. Creating a Report To create a report, select Export Data from the File menu. This will display the Export Data dialog. Configuring the Output Format Usage currently only supports saving reports as a delimited text file. The file will be UTF-8 encoded. Output File The file where the output will be written. The file will be overwritten if it already exists. Separator Files can be written using either a comma or a tab as the field separator. Include Header Row Include a header containing the column names as the first row of the file. Configuring the Report Type The three different report types, Databases , Users and Detail are described above. Switching report type will replace the currently selected list of columns with a default set of columns appropriate for the new type. Configuring the Date Range Usage offers three date range selection options. All Time The report will include all usage counts for all time. Last The report will include usage data for a number of preceding time periods. Selecting this option will enable a numeric input field to select the number of periods and a selector for the period type: Year(s) , Month(s) or Day(s) . For example, you could choose to include data for the previous 7 days, the last 6 months or the last 1 year. Custom The report will include usage for a fixed time period. Selecting this option will enable two date input fields to enter the start and end dates of the range. You do not need to specify both, they default to the earliest and latest data available, respectively. For example, you can generate a year-to-date report by setting the From date to January 1 of the current year and leaving the To date blank. The dates that you specify are inclusive, so the previous example includes usage on January 1. Configuring the Columns Each report type comes with a default set of columns. These consist of the database server and pathname for database/detail reports, the user name for user/detail reports and basic Notes, web and total usage counts. To remove one or more columns, select them in the column list and right-click to display the context menu. Choosing Remove from the menu will remove the selected columns. Note that the core catalog columns (database server and path, user name) cannot be removed since they are an essential part of the report. Attempting to remove them will display a warning message and the columns will not be removed. To add additional columns, click the Add button below the column list. This will display the Add Columns dialog. This dialog contains a categorized list of the columns available to be added to the the current report. You can select one or more columns to add to the report. If you have removed a column from the report accidentally, you can use this dialog to add it back. You may need to expand the categories to see the available columns. Sorting the Output Usage allows you to sort the report on any combination of columns. For each column, you can choose whether it should be sorted ascending, sorted descending or unsorted. Just like a standard Notes view, the first sorted column determines the primary sort order for the report, the next sorted column determines the secondary ordering and so on. You can drag columns up and down the list to rearrange the sort order if necessary. For example, to find the most used databases on each server, you would set the Server column to sort ascending, the Total Count column to sort descending and all other columns to sort None . This will group databases by server and then, within each server, arrange databases from the highest usage count to the lowest. You can interleave sorted and unsorted columns, so you may wish to leave the Pathname column next to the Server column to keep the full database path together, with the Total Count column following. Preview The Preview... button at the bottom left of the dialog will show up to 50 matching rows from the report. This allows you to check that you have the column definitions set up correctly before starting the export. It may take a long time for the preview dialog to display any rows if you have a lot of Usage data. In a sorted report, Usage needs to essentially generate the entire report in order to find the first few rows. However, the dialog will indicate that it is working, and you can close it at any time without waiting for the preview to complete. Loading and Saving Reports Usage allows you to save report configurations and reload them later. This is useful if, for example, you want to run the same report each month showing usage data for the previous month. The saved configuration contains the report type, date range and column configurations. It does not contain the output type and location since they may change from run to run. Saving a Report To save the current report configuration, click the Save... button. This will display a prompt asking for a name for the configuration. You can choose any descriptive name here, it is simply used so that you can identify the configuration when you want to load it again. A short name will work best. If a configuration with this name already exists, you will be asked whether you want to overwrite it. Loading a Report To load a report configuration, click the Load... button. This will display the Select Saved Configuration dialog. This shows all saved configurations, grouped by report type. Note You can delete a saved configuration from this dialog by right-clicking on a configuration and choosing Delete from the popup menu.","title":"Exporting Data"},{"location":"export/#exporting-data","text":"Usage allows you to export data from both the Catalog and Usage modules.

It has two modules: Catalog and Usage. Catalog The Catalog module reads information from your Domino server catalogs and address books to provide core lists of databases, templates and users. You can use the catalog to browse your databases by name, server, template or how recently they have been modified. The catalog module also allows you to configure filters to hide certain databases and users. More details are available on the Catalog page. Usage The Usage module imports usage information from your Domino server logs and displays detailed usage statistics for both users and databases. For a database, you can see how many times it was accessed and by whom, along with historical trends showing whether the usage is increasing or decreasing. For a user, you can see which databases and servers they accessed.

It allows you to view information about how much your databases are being used and who is using them. It distinguishes between web and client usage and also separates usage by individual users from usage by agents or servers. Running Server Scans The Domino server only retains usage information for fourteen days so it is important that you run server scans regularly to import the data before it is lost. The installation section explains how to configure Teamstudio Usage to run a scan every night. Viewing Usage To view usage data, select the second tab in the Usage window, titled Usage . About Dates and Times Teamstudio Usage stores all data internally in UTC. Usage statistics are computed at the day level, where a day is defined as midnight UTC to midnight UTC on the following day. Any time you see a date by itself in the UI, it corresponds to a UTC day. This allows Usage to handle data consistently from multiple servers in different time zones. Full datetimes (with both a date and a time) are also stored in UTC but are displayed in the UI in your local time zone. Viewing Databases With the Usage tab selected, select the Databases tab from the second tab row. This will display the usage database view. As with the Catalog, this view is split into two parts. On the left is a table showing all databases in the catalog, even those with no usage, sorted in decreasing order of total usage. Please see the Catalog page for details on how to sort and search this list. On the right is a details pane giving detailed usage information for the selected database. Filters Databases that have been excluded through filtering will not appear in the list. Also, all of the counts exclude usage by users that have been hidden through filtering. Table Columns Column Description User Total The total usage by users i.e., excluding usage by servers and agents. This is the sum of the Notes and Web columns. Notes The number of database sessions from Notes clients. A session consists of a user opening the database, interacting with it and then closing it again. The session count does not indicate how much work was performed during the session. Each session increases the count by one whether it accessed a single document or hundreds of documents. Web The number of times the database was accessed by users via HTTP. Since HTTP does not have a concept of sessions, this is a count of individual database accesses. For example, opening a page to view a single document might involve several database accesses to retrieve graphics stored as image resources in the database. Therefore the counts in this column tend to be significantly larger than the counts in the Notes column. Days The number of unique days on which the database was accessed by at least one user. Again, server and agent hits are excluded. Users The number of unique users that accessed the database Usage Counts The first section of the details pane shows the same counts that are in the main table, along with separate counts for agent and server usage. Users The second section of the details pane shows the breakdown of the Notes and Web user usage by user. It also shows the last date on which each user accessed the database. Agents Similar to the Users section, this section shows which agents have accessed database, along with a usage count for each. Trends This last section shows a graph of monthly user usage from Notes clients over time. Viewing Users With the Usage tab selected, select the Users tab from the second tab row. This will display the usage database view. This gives the usual two pane view, with a list of users and a details pane for the selected user. The user list is sorted in descending order of total usage by default. Unlike the database view, the list only includes users that have accessed at least one database. Table Columns Column Description Total Hits The total number of database accesses recorded for this user. See the database section above for details on how these this count is computed. Servers Accessed The number of different servers accessed by this user. Last Access The last day on which activity was found for this user. User Details The first section of the details pane shows the same counts that are in the main table. Databases The second section of the details pane shows the breakdown of the user's usage by database. It also includes the last date on which each user accessed the database. Servers The third section of the details pane shows the breakdown of the user's usage by server. Performance Usage data needs to be recomputed when the application is first launched and whenever filters change. When a database filter is added or removed, the user usage needs to be recomputed, and similarly when a user filter is added or removed, the database usage needs to be recomputed. Since this can take a little while, Teamstudio Usage does not automatically recompute the data. Instead, you will see a message at the top of the list alerting you that usage may have changed. The message has a link you can click to recompute the data. If the computation takes more than a few seconds, you will see a busy indicator. You can continue to work with the rest of application, and the indicator will disappear once the computation is complete. It is difficult to give estimates for how long the computation will take since servers vary greatly in size and usage. In our testing, a single server with 1,000 databases, a similar number of users and a year or so of data will be almost instantaneous. A collection of servers with about 10,000 total databases, 20,000 users and 4 years of usage data takes around 30 seconds.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage","text":"The Usage module collects detailed usage information stored in the Domino log file.
